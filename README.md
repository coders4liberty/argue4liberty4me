App that will generate liberty-based arguments in development. <br>

This is a beginner level Android app project. We initially followed the Code Babe Android Virgin tutorial.  https://codebabes.com/courses/android-virgin <br>
We fixed the build errors.
We added arrays and added code to randomly pick a string from the array. Now we just need more arugments. Add arguments to the arrays of strings on the MainActivity.java file.
